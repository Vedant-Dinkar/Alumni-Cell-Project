The Alumni Portal IITI consists of the Admin and the User interface.
Admin Interface has the following features: 
1. Check the views on the website(Could be fixed by increasing the view by one after every single visit, but it is not a suitable idea).
2. Create and Manage Events(Couldn't integrate the events properly).
3. Add Images to Gallery(Error while integrating).
4. Send Mails.
5. Make changes to College's reviews or the forums.

User Interface has the following features:
A) Non-Institute Random User:
1. Only view a couple of pages of the Alumni Portal Website and not get access to any data of the Alumni.
2. Check out events.

B) Institute User:
1. Chat with friends in private rooms.
2. Chat with others globally(Messages from everyone are being stored on our database, but we are having an error while printing messages from it, although the logic has been completed).
3. Create their own profiles, upload jobs, profile picture and search other users' profiles(Using GridFS, we apply the same logic for Profile Pictures as we did for Admin Events).
